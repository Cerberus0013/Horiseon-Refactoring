# Horiseon-Refactoring

This is a code refactoring/debugging project, in order to better hone my refactoring skills and my ability to create semantic HTML code, as well as to cut out any redundant CSS code.  


This project is not neccassarily usable, just an example of a static website thats been refactored so that a developer  can easily follow the flow of the code

I also added a special @media style in CSS to make the "seo" in Horiseon to disappear when the screen is under 500px in width. (Just for fun) 

I have listed the changes I made below..


## HTML:

* changed title to "Horiseon Online Marketing"
* changed div to nav
* <div class="header">-- renamed div with header class to be more semantic to <header> tags
* deleted benefits-lead, benefits-brand, benefits cost classes, and left the parent class benefits
* changed div class= footer to foorter tags
* added seach-engine-optimization i
* Added ALts"" to all images
* changed largest divs to sectio
* deleted classes in content section
* changed cost managment img  to self closing
* updated notes inside of HTML and CSS

## CSS
* swapped out Nav for div in all
* removed header class
* deleted benefits-lead, benefits-brand, benefits cost and combined there attributes into 
* took all the redundant benfits CSS code and turned them into 3 easy to read css
* did the same in the content sectio
* consolidated content sections from 9 to 
* updated notes for reference
